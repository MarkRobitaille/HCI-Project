# Family Folder  
This is our group's HCI high-fidelity prototype. It is designed as a communication tool for families. As such, it includes features like a messenger, shared calendar, and shared lists. The project was developed utilizing user-centered design and went through numerous prototyping phrases to reach this final interface. After completing this high-fidelity prototype, our group carried out a heuristic analysis and were able to find numerous improvements we could implement.  

**Note**: This project was designed and tested according to the project's requirements of running in a Chrome browser on a desktop. Therefore, this website will not scale to mobile and certain aspects (like displaying dates/time) may have issues in other browsers.
